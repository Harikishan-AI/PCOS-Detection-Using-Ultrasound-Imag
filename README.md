# PCOS-Detection-Using-Ultrasound-Imag

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine condition in
reproductive-age women. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial. This study
presents a novel approach, employing advanced picture segmentation and
CNN-based deep learning on a diverse PCOS ultrasound image dataset. We
preprocess images, segment ovarian follicles and cysts, and leverage deep
learning for automated feature extraction. Our method outperforms manual
interpretation, offering a more reliable and objective PCOS diagnosis. This
breakthrough has the potential to enhance patient outcomes and
reproductive health. Future research aims to refine and implement this
approach in clinical settings

## Problem Statement

The current diagnosis process heavily relies on subjective manual
interpretation of ultrasound images, which can be challenging and prone to
human bias. This study addresses this problem by proposing an innovative
ultrasound-based PCOS detection method that combines advanced
picture segmentation and CNN-based deep learning. The goal is to create
an automated and objective diagnostic solution that improves the
accuracy of PCOS identification and subsequently enhances patient
outcomes and reproductive health."

## Methodology

1. Data Collection
 -Gather diverse ultrasound images from PCOS and non-PCOS cases.
 -Apply rigorous preprocessing for data quality and uniformity.
2. Image Segmentation:
 -Employ advanced segmentation techniques to isolate relevant anatomical structures.
 -Focus on ovarian cysts and follicles for PCOS diagnosis.
3. Deep Learning Model:
 -Develop a CNN-based model (YOLOv8.0.20) for multi-class classification.
 -Train on preprocessed data, augmenting for generalization.
4. Validation and Testing:
 -Apply robust cross-validation and independent testing.
 -Measure accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and other key metrics.
