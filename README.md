# PCOS-Detection-Using-Ultrasound-Imag

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine condition in
reproductive-age women. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial. This study
presents a novel approach, employing advanced picture segmentation and
CNN-based deep learning on a diverse PCOS ultrasound image dataset. We
preprocess images, segment ovarian follicles and cysts, and leverage deep
learning for automated feature extraction. Our method outperforms manual
interpretation, offering a more reliable and objective PCOS diagnosis. This
breakthrough has the potential to enhance patient outcomes and
reproductive health. Future research aims to refine and implement this
approach in clinical settings
