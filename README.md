# PCOS-Detection-Using-Ultrasound-Imag

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine condition in
reproductive-age women. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial. This study
presents a novel approach, employing advanced picture segmentation and
CNN-based deep learning on a diverse PCOS ultrasound image dataset. We
preprocess images, segment ovarian follicles and cysts, and leverage deep
learning for automated feature extraction. Our method outperforms manual
interpretation, offering a more reliable and objective PCOS diagnosis. This
breakthrough has the potential to enhance patient outcomes and
reproductive health. Future research aims to refine and implement this
approach in clinical settings

## Problem Statement

The current diagnosis process heavily relies on subjective manual
interpretation of ultrasound images, which can be challenging and prone to
human bias. This study addresses this problem by proposing an innovative
ultrasound-based PCOS detection method that combines advanced
picture segmentation and CNN-based deep learning. The goal is to create
an automated and objective diagnostic solution that improves the
accuracy of PCOS identification and subsequently enhances patient
outcomes and reproductive health."

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- **Source Diverse Data:** Gather a comprehensive set of ultrasound images from both PCOS and non-PCOS cases.
- **Data Quality:** Apply rigorous preprocessing steps to ensure data quality, uniformity, and consistency across the dataset.

### 2. Image Segmentation
- **Advanced Techniques:** Use cutting-edge segmentation techniques to accurately isolate relevant anatomical structures in the ultrasound images.
- **Focus Areas:** Concentrate on segmenting ovarian cysts and follicles, which are critical for PCOS diagnosis.

### 3. Deep Learning Model
- **CNN Architecture:** Develop a CNN-based model using YOLOv8.0.20, optimized for multi-class classification tasks.
- **Training:** Train the model on preprocessed and augmented data to improve generalization and robustness.

### 4. Validation and Testing
- **Cross-Validation:** Implement robust cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance.
- **Independent Testing:** Evaluate the model on an independent test set, measuring accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and other essential metrics.
